## What I'm up to...

- **Research Assistant @ Mount Sinai Cath Lab**

Developed algorithm using Python and NumPy to autonomously extract patient physiological parameters from Ballistocardiograph cardiac signal, enabling advanced monitoring of heart failure patients. Refactored and modularized analysis pipeline to seamlessly transition between various clinical trial data. Validated algorithm against electrocardiograph signals, achieving 93% accuracy and high agreement. Won Best Abstract in Translational Research (Transform HF Showcase, $250 prize), Best Presentation
(UNERD Conference), First Place (with lab, Transform HF Ideathon, $12750 prize).

- **Software Developer @ iGEM Toronto**

Modelling, writing algorithms, graphing and pipetting. I help genetically engineer bacteria by simulatings models to predict how they will behave with different genetic circuits. By building digital metabolic networks of the bacteria's key mechanisms, I predict what genetic changes - knock-outs, additions, over-expression - will result in improved efficiency. This year, we are modifying bacteria to imrpove their ability to consume methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
On top of my software work, I pick up lab work when I can. I am also part of the entrepreneurship team, where I help with business development and go-to-market strategy for our project.
